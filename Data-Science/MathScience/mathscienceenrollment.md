**Math, Science Courses and Enrollment**

**Objective**

The purpose of the documentation is to provide analysis on math, science courses and its enrollment in the District of Columbia schools for the school year of 2011-2012. Within this document there will be a Science and Math section which will provide a subsection of each course. This document demonstrates tools that were used to derive at this data analysis which is listed in the technology resources section. 

**Technology Resources**

*Math and Science Courses are located in a csv file. 
*	Enrollment is located in the Math and Science folder as a .csv file. Math and Science courses were gathered and combined with Enrollment.
*	Math, Science, and Enrollment data were imported into PostgreSQL SQL database to perform queries.  The following sections describe which queries were performed. 
*	Export query data into an Excel spreadsheet and display graphs.
*	Final data will be displayed upon GitHub account along with the documentation that is written. 

**Science**
*The data compiled contained the following science files: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. 

**Physics**
The overall total male enrollment for 33 schools were 1,097. There were a total of 160 classes offered in Physics. The highest class in Physics offered were 25 having Friendship PCS Woodson Collegiate Campus leading. The average physics classes were 5 and the average male enrollment was 33.
